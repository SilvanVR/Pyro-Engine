v1.0.1:
- fixed look at matrix (was left handed before)
- fixed perspective matrix 

v1.02:
- added rectangle-class

v1.03:
- made all data fields in vec2, vec3, vec4 and quat private and as an array
--> Field access now through functions e.g. vec2.x()b

v1.04:
- removed vec - unions from Mat3x3 and Mat4x4
- updated Rectangle-Class
- removed initializer list in vec2, vec3, vec4, quaternion

v1.05:
- added explicit conversion Point -> Vec3
- added getTranslation() function in Mat4x4-class

v1.06:
- added operator point * scalar (and float * point).. scalar * point make some problems
- get scale from a matrix

v1.07:
- added quaternion operators (+, -, *)
- rewrote slerp / lerp
- get a quaternion from a transformation matrix

v1.08:
- swapped left/right and forward/back static vectors in Vec3 + Vec2 + quaternion-class
 -> Forward is now (0,0,1) instead of (0,0,-1) and left is now (1,0,0) instead of (-1,0,0)

v1.09:
- added isValid() function for all vector types which checks if the 
  values are not FLT_MAX (include <cfloat> in utils.h)
- added static INVALID vectors
