# Pyro-Engine



My first real project, which i started in March 2016 in preparation for my bachelor thesis 
(Here the link btw: https://www.dropbox.com/s/z1v8gcx79xs8xus/SilvanHau%20BachelorThesis.pdf?dl=0). 
At that time i had almost no knowledge about C++, Visual Studio (which can be quite a pain if not familiar with)
and graphics programming.
But I've managed to implement everything i wanted and never gave up, even when i did spent sometimes hours of debugging just to
find out that the error lies in the driver x)
Besides i had to work with the vulkan specification directly (and this without proper preexperience) because the 1.0 specification
were originally released one month after i started this project in 02/2016. This was quite a challenge and today i'd say
that starting with vulkan is a bad idea. It's made for performance but only if you have the proper knowledge about it.

This is mainly the reason why the code is not very clean and changed a lot several times, resulting in a poor overall
structure. Because of that i decided to create a new engine using DirectX 11.
